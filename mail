Subject: Deactivated User Appeal

Dear OpenAI support team,

Hello, I am a registered user on openai.com, and my username is oliegsan. Recently I found out that my account was suspended, and I would like to know the reason and request to reactivate my account.

I admit that I made a mistake, which was to write my OpenAI API key on GitHub. This was an unintentional error, and I did not realize what consequences it would have. I have deleted the key from GitHub and no longer use it. I also did not use it for anything illegal or unethical.

I am very sorry for causing you trouble, and I hope you can forgive my mistake and reactivate my account. I promise that I will not make the same mistake again, and I will follow all the terms and policies of OpenAI.

Thank you for your attention and understanding. Please reply to me as soon as possible and let me know if there is anything else I need to do.

Sincerely, oliegsan.
